#+title: User-Level configuration
#+author: Luigi D. C. Soares

This module is structured as follows:

- [[file:editor/][editor/]] sets up some editors and define the main one
- [[file:security/][security]] sets up security-related programs (gpg, pass, ssh)
- [[file:shell/][shell/]] sets up the user's shell (plugins, theme, aliases)
- [[file:tools/][tools/]] sets up some useful tools
- [[file:ui/][ui/]] sets up user-interface aspects
- [[file:wezterm/][wezterm/]] holds my wezterm configuration

These submodules are aggregated into the following [[file:default.nix][default.nix]]:

#+begin_src nix :tangle default.nix
{ catppuccin, username, rootPath, ... }:
{ ... }: {
  imports = [
    ./editor
    (import ./security { inherit rootPath; })
    (import ./shell { inherit rootPath; })
    (import ./ui { inherit catppuccin; })
    ./tools
  ];

  home = {
    inherit username;
    homeDirectory = "/home/${username}";
  };

  # This value determines the Home Manager release that your
  # configuration is compatible with. This helps avoid breakage
  # when a new Home Manager release introduces backwards
  # incompatible changes.
  #
  # You can update Home Manager without changing this value. See
  # the Home Manager release notes for a list of state version
  # changes in each release.
  home.stateVersion = "23.11";

  # Let Home Manager install and manage itself.
  programs.home-manager.enable = true;
