#+title: User-Level Configuration
#+author: Luigi D. C. Soares

This module is structured as follows:

- [[file:emacs/][emacs/]] sets up the emacs package and configuration
- [[file:nvim/][nvim/]] sets up neovim (as a fallback editor; sometimes I switch betweem them)
- [[file:security/][security]] sets up security-related programs (gpg, pass, ssh)
- [[file:shell/][shell/]] sets up the user's shell (plugins, theme, aliases)
- [[file:tools/][tools/]] sets up some useful tools
- [[file:ui/][ui/]] sets up user-interface aspects
- [[file:wezterm/][wezterm/]] holds my wezterm configuration
- [[file:zathura/][zathura/]] sets up zathura pdf reader

These submodules are aggregated into the following [[file:default.nix][default.nix]]:

#+begin_src nix :tangle default.nix

  imports = [

  ];

  home = {

    homeDirectory = "/home/${username}";
  };

  # This value determines the Home Manager release that your
  # configuration is compatible with. This helps avoid breakage
  # when a new Home Manager release introduces backwards
  # incompatible changes.
  #
  # You can update Home Manager without changing this value. See
  # the Home Manager release notes for a list of state version
  # changes in each release.
  home.stateVersion = "23.11";

  # Let Home Manager install and manage itself.
  programs.home-manager.enable = true;
