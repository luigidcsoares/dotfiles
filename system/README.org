#+title: System-Level Configuration
#+author: Luigi D. C. Soares

This module is structured as follows:

- [[file:dev/][dev/]] sets up development packages
- [[file:docker/][docker/]] sets up, well, docker
- [[file:ui/][ui/]] sets up user-interface elements, such as fonts
- [[file:wsl/][wsl/]] enables nixos wsl and set up some utilities

These submodules are aggregated into [[file:default.nix][default.nix]], defined below. Remember to change the time zone as appropiate (TODO: how to automate this?).

  # This value determines the NixOS release from which the default
  # settings for stateful data, like file locations and database
  # versions on your system were taken. It's perfectly fine and
  # recommended to leave this value at the release version of the
  # first install of this system.  Before changing this value read the
  # documentation for this option (e.g. man configuration.nix or on
  # https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html).
